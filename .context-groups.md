# Context Groups

Organize your codebase into logical groups for AI-assisted development.
This file is used by contexTUI to provide quick context loading for Claude and other AI tools.

## Format

```markdown
## group-name
layer: <layer-id>        # Which architectural layer (docs, ui, feature, data, integration)
parent: <parent-group>   # Optional: nest under another group
tags: [tag1, tag2]       # Optional: cross-cutting concerns
contains: [child1]       # Optional: list of child groups (for readability)

Description of what this group contains and when to use it.

- path/to/file1.ts
- path/to/file2.tsx
```

## Usage

**In contexTUI:**
- Files show `[group-name]` badges in the tree view
- Press `g` to open the swimlane view (groups organized by layer)
- Navigate: `h/l` switch layers, `j/k` switch groups
- Press `enter` or `c` to copy all files as `@filepath` references

**For AI Agents:**
When asked to work on a feature, look for a relevant context group here. Groups are
self-contained units of related functionality. Copy the group to load all necessary
context at once, rather than searching for files individually.

**Creating Groups:**
Create a group when you have files that are frequently used together. Good candidates:
- Feature implementations spanning multiple files
- Related files across different directories
- Context you'd copy-paste to Claude regularly

**Design Principle:**
Text lives in files, not inline. If you need to add instructions or notes, create a
markdown file and include it in the group. This keeps groups composable - the same
file can be referenced by multiple groups.

**Git:** Commit this file so team members share the same context group definitions.
