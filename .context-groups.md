# Context Groups

This project uses structured documentation as context groups.
Each group is a markdown file with metadata: Supergroup, Status,
Description, Key Files, and optionally Related and Out of Scope.

Supergroups are auto-discovered from markdown files. To create a custom
supergroup, just set `**Supergroup:** YourCategory` in any markdown file.

## Supergroups (auto-discovered)

- Meta
- Feature
- Miscellaneous

## Active Groups

- docs/context-groups-v2.md (Meta, Active)
- VISION.md (Meta, Active)
- README.md (Meta, Active)
- docs/groups-feature.md (Feature, Active)
- docs/git-integration.md (?, ?)
