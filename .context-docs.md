# Context Docs

This project uses structured documentation as context docs.
Each doc is a markdown file with metadata: Category, Status,
Description, Key Files, and optionally Related and Out of Scope.

Categories are auto-discovered from markdown files. To create a custom
category, just set `**Category:** YourCategory` in any markdown file.
